# FIRST PERSON LOCOMOTION SYSTEM
This project aims to create a simple movement system for a first-person perspective, parkour-styled game. 
The movement system is designed to handle various actions such as wall running, grappling, dashing and blending using animations. 

Here is a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oiklUJDf0w) of all the components in action

I am currently working on extending it to a full game!
